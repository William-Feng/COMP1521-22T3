Consider a file of size 10000 bytes, open for reading on file f,
initially positioned at the start of the file (offset 0).
What will be the file position after each of these calls to lseek()?
Assume that they are executed in sequence and one will change the file state that the next one deals with.

lseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);
10000

lseek(f, -1000, SEEK_CUR);
9000

lseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);
0

lseek(f, -100, SEEK_SET);
0

lseek(f, 1000, SEEK_SET);
1000

lseek(f, 1000, SEEK_CUR);
2000
