On a 16 bit system, we have 65536 possible integers that we can represent.
Possible range (for signed integers): -2^15 ~ (2^15 - 1) = -32768 ~ 32767

(30000 + 30000) will overflow to the negative values

We need to specify that we are dealing with unsigned integers.
Possible range (for unsigned integers): 0 ~ (2^16 - 1) = 0 ~ 65535

30000u + 30000u
