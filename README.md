# COMP1521 22T3 F09A Tutorial

Hey there! This Git repository contains all the resources and code covered during the tutorial each week.

If you're unfamiliar with Git and wish to download the entire repository, you can click on the green 'Code' dropdown button and select 'Download ZIP'. Otherwise, you can clone this repository and pull the updates after each week.

Of course, you can also select the relevant week and file if you just wish to view the code.

Happy coding ðŸ˜Š
